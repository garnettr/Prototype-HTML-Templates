This is a mobile first design, fully responsive template built for a WordPress theme. <br>
I had the opportunity to design and build this site for a really great client and I canâ€™t thank them enough for trusting me to complete the task.

Being the only designer and developer, this created both challenges and opportunities to overcome.
Working closely with the client to capture everything they needed in launching their new vehicle wrap business.

This prototype template was built for a custom WordPress theme, but also to provide the client with a better idea of what the final site will function like. 


We also build a responsive coming soon site, for users to visit before the full site was launched. http://igarnett.com/coming-soon/
